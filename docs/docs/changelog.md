# Changelog

## v3.18.0

- Show aliases on `task --list --silent` (`task --ls`). This means that aliases
  will be completed by the completion scripts
  ([#919](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/919)).
- Tasks in the root Taskfile will now be displayed first in `--list`/`--list-all`
  output ([#806](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/806), [#890](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/890)).
- It's now possible to call a `default` task in an included Taskfile by using
  just the namespace. For example: `docs:default` is now automatically
  aliased to `docs`
  ([#661](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/661), [#815](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/815)).

## v3.17.0

- Add a "Did you mean ...?" suggestion when a task does not exits another one
  with a similar name is found
  ([#867](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/867), [#880](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/880)).
- Now YAML parse errors will print which Taskfile failed to parse
  ([#885](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/885), [#887](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/887)).
- Add ability to set `aliases` for tasks and namespaces ([#268](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/268), [#340](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/340), [#879](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/879)).
- Improvements to Fish shell completion
  ([#897](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/897)).
- Added ability to set a different watch interval by setting
  `interval: '500ms'` or using the `--interval=500ms` flag
  ([#813](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/813), [#865](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/865)).
- Add colored output to `--list`, `--list-all` and `--summary` flags ([#845](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/845), [#874](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/874)).
- Fix unexpected behavior where `label:` was being shown instead of the task
  name on `--list`
  ([#603](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/603), [#877](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/877)).

## v3.16.0 - 2022-09-29

  ([#870](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/870), [#871](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/871), [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@go-task/cli)).
- Add support to marking tasks and includes as internal, which will hide them
  from `--list` and `--list-all`
  ([#818](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/818)).

## v3.15.2 - 2022-09-08

- Fix error when using variable in `env:` introduced in the previous release
  ([#858](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/858), [#866](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/866)).
- Fix handling of `CLI_ARGS` (`--`) in Bash completion
  ([#863](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/863)).
- On zsh completion, add ability to replace `--list-all` with `--list` as
  already possible on the Bash completion
  ([#861](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/861)).

## v3.15.0 - 2022-09-03

## v3.14.0 - 2022-07-08

- Add ability to override the `.task` directory location with the
  `TASK_TEMP_DIR` environment variable.
- Allow to override Task colors using environment variables:
  `TASK_COLOR_RESET`, `TASK_COLOR_BLUE`, `TASK_COLOR_GREEN`,
  `TASK_COLOR_CYAN`, `TASK_COLOR_YELLOW`, `TASK_COLOR_MAGENTA`
  and `TASK_COLOR_RED`
  ([#568](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/568), [#792](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/792)).
- Fixed bug when using the `output: group` mode where STDOUT and STDERR were
  being print in separated blocks instead of in the right order
  ([#779](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/779)).
- Starting on this release, ARM architecture binaries are been released to Snap
  as well
  ([#795](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/795)).
- i386 binaries won't be available anymore on Snap because Ubuntu removed the support
  for this architecture.

  for the processes running to do cleanup work
  ([#458](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/458), [#479](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/479), [#728](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/728), [#769](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/769)).
- Add new `--exit-code` (`-x`) flag that will pass-through the exit form the
  command being ran
  ([#755](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/755)).

## v3.12.1 - 2022-05-10

- Fixed bug where, on Windows, variables were ending with `\r` because we were
  only removing the final `\n` but not `\r\n`
  ([#717](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/717)).

## v3.12.0 - 2022-03-31

- The `--list` and `--list-all` flags can now be combined with the `--silent`
  flag to print the task names only, without their description
  ([#691](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/691)).
- Added support for multi-level inclusion of Taskfiles. This means that
  included Taskfiles can also include other Taskfiles. Before this was limited
  to one level
  ([#390](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/390), [#623](https://github.com/go-task/task/discussions/623), [#656](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/656)).

## v3.11.0 - 2022-02-19

- Task now supports printing begin and end messages when using the `group`
  output mode, useful for grouping tasks in CI systems.

  ([#647](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/647), [#651](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/651)).
- Add `Taskfile.dist.yml` and `Taskfile.dist.yaml` to the supported file
  name list. [Check out the documentation](https://taskfile.dev/#/usage?id=supported-file-names) for more information
  ([#498](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/498), [#666](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/666)).

## v3.10.0 - 2022-01-04

- A new `--list-all` (alias `-a`) flag is now available. It's similar to the
  exiting `--list` (`-l`) but prints all tasks, even those without a
  description
  ([#383](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/383), [#401](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/401)).
- It's now possible to schedule cleanup commands to run once a task finishes
  with the `defer:` keyword
  ([Documentation](https://taskfile.dev/#/usage?id=doing-task-cleanup-with-defer), [#475](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/475), [#626](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/626)).

- Fixed error when computing a variable when the task directory do not exist
  yet
  ([#481](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/481), [#579](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/579)).

  This is a long time requested feature. Enjoy!
  ([#53](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/53), [#359](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/359)).

## v3.6.0 - 2021-07-10

## v3.4.1 - 2021-04-17

- Improve error reporting when parsing YAML: in some situations where you
  would just see an generic error, you'll now see the actual error with
  more detail: the YAML line the failed to parse, for example
  ([#467](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/467)).
- A JSON Schema was published [here](https://json.schemastore.org/taskfile.json)
  and is automatically being used by some editors like Visual Studio Code
  ([#135](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/135)).

- Fix the `.task` directory being created in the task directory instead of the
  Taskfile directory
  ([#247](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/247)).
- Fix a bug where dynamic variables (those declared with `sh:`) were not
  running in the task directory when the task has a custom dir or it was
  in an included Taskfile
  ([#384](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/384)).
- The watch feature (via the `--watch` flag) got a few different bug fixes and
  should be more stable now
  ([#423](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/423), [#365](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/365)).

## v3.1.0 - 2021-01-03

- Fix a bug when the checksum up-to-date resolution is used by a task
  with a custom `label:` attribute
  ([#412](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/412)).
- Starting from this release, we're releasing official ARMv6 and ARM64 binaries
  for Linux
  ([#375](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/375), [#418](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/418)).
- Task now respects the order of declaration of included Taskfiles when
  evaluating variables declaring by them
  ([#393](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/393)).
- `set -e` is now automatically set on every command. This was done to fix an
  issue where multiline string commands wouldn't really fail unless the
  sentence was in the last line
  ([#403](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/403)).

## v3.0.1 - 2020-12-26

- Allow use as a library by moving the required packages out of the `internal`
  directory
  ([#358](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/358)).
- Do not error if a specified dotenv file does not exist
  ([#378](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/378), [#385](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/385)).
- Fix panic when you have empty tasks in your Taskfile
  ([#338](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/338), [#362](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/362)).

## v3.0.0 - 2020-08-16

- On `v3`, all CLI variables will be considered global variables
  ([#336](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/336), [#341](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/341))
- Add support to `.env` like files
  ([#324](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/324), [#356](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/356)).
- Add `label:` to task so you can override the task name in the logs
  ([#321](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/321]), [#337](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/337)).
- Refactor how variables work on version 3
  ([#311](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/311)).
- Disallow `expansions` on v3 since it has no effect.
- `Taskvars.yml` is not automatically included anymore.
- `Taskfile_{{OS}}.yml` is not automatically included anymore.
- Allow interpolation on `includes`, so you can manually include a Taskfile
  based on operation system, for example.
- Expose `.TASK` variable in templates with the task name
  ([#252](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/252)).
- Implement short task syntax
  ([#194](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/194), [#240](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/240)).
- Added option to make included Taskfile run commands on its own directory
  ([#260](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/260), [#144](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/144))
- Taskfiles in version 1 are not supported anymore
  ([#237](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/237)).
- Added global `method:` option. With this option, you can set a default
  method to all tasks in a Taskfile
  ([#246](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/246)).
- Changed default method from `timestamp` to `checksum`
  ([#246](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/246)).
- New magic variables are now available when using `status:`:
  `.TIMESTAMP` which contains the greatest modification date
  from the files listed in `sources:`, and `.CHECKSUM`, which
  contains a checksum of all files listed in `status:`.
  This is useful for manual checking when using external, or even remote,
  artifacts when using `status:`
  ([#216](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/216)).
- We're now using [slim-sprig](https://github.com/go-task/slim-sprig) instead of
  [sprig](https://github.com/Masterminds/sprig), which allowed a file size
  reduction of about 22%
  ([#219](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/219)).
- We now use some colors on Task output to better distinguish message types -
  commands are green, errors are red, etc
  ([#207](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/207)).

## v2.8.1 - 2020-05-20

- Fix error code for the `--help` flag
  ([#300](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/300), [#330](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/330)).
- Print version to stdout instead of stderr
  ([#299](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/299), [#329](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/329)).
- Supress `context` errors when using the `--watch` flag
  ([#313](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/313), [#317](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/317)).
- Support templating on description
  ([#276](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/276), [#283](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/283)).

## v2.8.0 - 2019-12-07
