# Community

Some of the work to improve the Task ecosystem is done by the community, be
it installation methods or integrations with code editor. I (the author) am
thankful for everyone that helps me to improve the overall experience.



## Awesome Taskfiles:

- [awesome-taskfile](https://github.com/better-sre/awesome-taskfile)
- Collect some `Taskfiles` written by community developers.


## Editor Integrations

### JSON Schema

[@KROSF](https://github.com/KROSF) worked on a JSON Schema [into this Gist](https://gist.github.com/KROSF/c5435acf590acd632f71bb720f685895),
which later was made officially available by [@Crandel](https://github.com/Crandel)
at [https://json.schemastore.org/taskfile.json](https://json.schemastore.org/taskfile.json).
Further improvements are possible by opening pull requests changing
[this file](https://github.com/SchemaStore/schemastore/blob/master/src/schemas/json/taskfile.json).
Some code editors, like Visual Studio Code, make use of Schema Store
automatically.

### Visual Studio Code extension

Additionally, there's also some work done by
[@paulvarache](https://github.com/paulvarache) in making an Visual Studio Code
extension, which has its code [here](https://github.com/paulvarache/vscode-taskfile)
and is published [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulvarache.vscode-taskfile).

### Sublime Text 4 package

There is a convenience wrapper for initializing and running tasks from Sublime Text's command palette. The package is
developed by [@biozz](https://github.com/biozz), the source code is available [here](https://github.com/biozz/sublime-taskfile)
and it is published on Package Control [here](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Taskfile).

### IntelliJ plugin

There's a JetBrains IntelliJ plugin done by
[@lechuckroh](https://github.com/lechuckroh), which has its code [here](https://github.com/lechuckroh/task-intellij-plugin)
and is published [here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17058-taskfile).
