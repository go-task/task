# Translate

Want to help us translate this documentation? In this document we explain how.

Do NOT edit translated markdown files directly on the GitHub repository! We use
[Crowdin][crowdin] to allow contributors on work on translations. The repository
is periodically updated with progress from Crowdin.

If you want to have access to the Crowdin project to be able to suggest
translations, please ask for access on the [#translations channel on our Discord
server][discord]. If a given language is not being shown to Crowdin yet, just
ask and we can configure it.
