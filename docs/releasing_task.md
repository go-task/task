# Releasing Task

The release process of Task is done with the help of
[GoReleaser][goreleaser]. You can test the release process locally by calling
the `test-release` task of the Taskfile.

The Travis CI should release automatically when a new
Git tag is pushed to master, either for the artifact uploading (raw executables
and DEB and RPM packages)

# Homebrew

To release a new version on the [Homebrew tap][homebrewtap] edit the
[Formula/go-task.rb][gotaskrb] file, updating with the new version, download
URL and sha256.

# Snapcraft

The exception is the publishing of a new version of the
[snap package][snappackage]. This current require two steps after publishing
the binaries:

* Updating the current version on [snapcraft.yaml][snapcraftyaml];
* Moving both `i386` and `amd64` new artifacts to the stable channel on
the [Snapcraft dashboard][snapcraftdashboard]

# Scoop

Scoop is a community owned installation method. Scoop owners usually take care
of updating versions there by editing
[this file](https://github.com/lukesampson/scoop-extras/blob/master/bucket/task.json).
If you think its Task version is outdated, open an issue to let us know.
