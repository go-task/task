# Bağış Yapma

If you find this project useful, you can consider donating by using one of the channels listed below.

This is just a way of saying "thank you", it won't give you any benefits like higher priority on issues or something similar.

Companies who donate at least $50/month will be featured as a "Gold Sponsor" in the website homepage and on the GitHub repository README. Make contact with [@andreynering][] with the logo you want to be shown. Suspect businesses (gambling, casinos, etc) won't be allowed, though.

## GitHub Sponsorları
