# Deprecations

As Task evolves, it occasionally outgrows some of its functionality. This can be because they are no longer useful, because another feature has replaced it or because of a change in the way that Task works internally.

When this happens, we mark the functionality as deprecated. This means that it will be removed in a future version of Task. This functionality will continue to work until that time, but we strongly recommend that you do not implement this functionality in new Taskfiles and make a plan to migrate away from it as soon as possible.

You can view a full list of active deprecations in the "Deprecations" section of the sidebar.
