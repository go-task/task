- Fixed a bug where dynamic variables were causing errors during fast compilation (#1435, #1437 by @pd93)

## v3.33.0 - 2023-12-20

- Added [Any Variables experiment](https://taskfile.dev/experiments/any-variables) (#1415, #1421 by @pd93).
- Updated Docusaurus to v3 (#1432 by @pd93).
- Added `aliases` to `--json` flag output (#1430, #1431 by @pd93).
- Added new `CLI_FORCE` special variable containing whether the `--force` or `--force-all` flags were set (#1412, #1434 by @pd93).

## v3.32.0 - 2023-11-29

- Added ability to exclude some files from `sources:` by using `exclude:` (#225,

  # 1324 by @pd93 and @andreynering).
- The [Remote Taskfiles experiment](https://taskfile.dev/experiments/remote-taskfiles) now prefers remote files over cached ones by default (#1317, #1345 by @pd93).
- Added `--timeout` flag to the [Remote Taskfiles experiment](https://taskfile.dev/experiments/remote-taskfiles) (#1317, #1345 by @pd93).
- Fix bug where dynamic `vars:` and `env:` were being executed when they should actually be skipped by `platforms:` (#1273, #1377 by @andreynering).
- Fix `schema.json` to make `silent` valid in `cmds` that use `for` (#1385,

  # 1386 by @iainvm).
- Add new `--no-status` flag to skip expensive status checks when running `task --list --json` (#1348, #1368 by @amancevice).

## v3.31.0 - 2023-10-07

- Enabled the `--yes` flag for the [Remote Taskfiles experiment](https://taskfile.dev/experiments/remote-taskfiles) (#1317, #1344 by @pd93).
- Add ability to set `watch: true` in a task to automatically run it in watch mode (#231, #1361 by @andreynering).

- Fixed a nil pointer error when running a Taskfile with no contents (#1341,

  # 1342 by @pd93).

- Increased limit of maximum task calls from 100 to 1000 for now, as some people have been reaching this limit organically now that we have loops. This check exists to detect recursive calls, but will be removed in favor of a better algorithm soon (#1321, #1332).

- Fix bug on `--status` flag. Running this flag should not have side-effects: it should not update the checksum on `.task`, only report its status (#1305,

  # 1307 by @visciang, #1313 by @andreynering).

## v3.28.0 - 2023-07-24

## v3.26.0 - 2023-06-10

- Only rewrite checksum files in `.task` if the checksum has changed (#1185,

  # 1194 by @deviantintegral).
- Added [experiments documentation](https://taskfile.dev/experiments) to the website (#1198 by @pd93).

We're looking to gather feedback from the community so please give it a go and let us know what you think via a [discussion](https://github.com/go-task/vscode-task/discussions), [issue](https://github.com/go-task/vscode-task/issues) or on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/6TY36E39UK)!

> **NOTE:** The extension _requires_ v3.23.0 to be installed in order to work.

- The website was integrated with [Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/taskfile) to allow the community to contribute with translations! [Chinese](https://taskfile.dev/zh-Hans/) is the first language available (#1057, #1058 by @misitebao).

- Add new `platforms:` attribute to `task` and `cmd`, so it's now possible to choose in which platforms that given task or command will be run on. Possible values are operating system (GOOS), architecture (GOARCH) or a combination of the two. Example: `platforms: [linux]`, `platforms: [amd64]` or `platforms: [linux/amd64]`. Other platforms will be skipped (#978, #980 by @leaanthony).

- Task now respects the order of declaration of included Taskfiles when evaluating variables declaring by them (#393).
- `set -e` is now automatically set on every command. This was done to fix an issue where multiline string commands wouldn't really fail unless the sentence was in the last line (#403).

## v3.0.1 - 2020-12-26

- Allow use as a library by moving the required packages out of the `internal` directory (#358).
- Do not error if a specified dotenv file does not exist (#378, #385).
- Fix panic when you have empty tasks in your Taskfile (#338, #362).

## v3.0.0 - 2020-08-16

- On `v3`, all CLI variables will be considered global variables (#336, #341)
- Add support to `.env` like files (#324, #356).
- Add `label:` to task so you can override the task name in the logs (#321,

  # 337).
- Refactor how variables work on version 3 (#311).
- Disallow `expansions` on v3 since it has no effect.
- `Taskvars.yml` is not automatically included anymore.
- `Taskfile_{{OS}}.yml` is not automatically included anymore.
- Allow interpolation on `includes`, so you can manually include a Taskfile based on operation system, for example.
- Expose `.TASK` variable in templates with the task name (#252).
- Implement short task syntax (#194, #240).
- Added option to make included Taskfile run commands on its own directory (#260, #144)
- Taskfiles in version 1 are not supported anymore (#237).
- Added global `method:` option. With this option, you can set a default method to all tasks in a Taskfile (#246).
- Changed default method from `timestamp` to `checksum` (#246).
- New magic variables are now available when using `status:`: `.TIMESTAMP` which contains the greatest modification date from the files listed in `sources:`, and `.CHECKSUM`, which contains a checksum of all files listed in `status:`. This is useful for manual checking when using external, or even remote, artifacts when using `status:` (#216).
- We're now using [slim-sprig](https://github.com/go-task/slim-sprig) instead of [sprig](https://github.com/Masterminds/sprig), which allowed a file size reduction of about 22% (#219).
- We now use some colors on Task output to better distinguish message types - commands are green, errors are red, etc (#207).

- Add `preconditions:` to task (#205).
- Create directory informed on `dir:` if it doesn't exist (#209, #211).

- Fixed to the ZSH completion (#182).
- Add [`--summary` flag along with `summary:` task attribute](https://taskfile.org/#/usage?id=display-summary-of-task) (#180).
