# Community

Some of the work to improve the Task ecosystem is done by the community, be it installation methods or integrations with code editor. I (the author) am thankful for everyone that helps me to improve the overall experience.

## Translations

[@DeronW](https://github.com/DeronW) maintains  the [Chinese translation](https://task-zh.readthedocs.io/zh_CN/latest/) of the website [on this repository](https://github.com/DeronW/task).

## Editor Integrations

### JSON Schema

Initial work on the schema was made by [@KROSF](https://github.com/KROSF) on [this Gist](https://gist.github.com/KROSF/c5435acf590acd632f71bb720f685895). The schema is currently available at https://taskfile.dev/schema.json and linked at https://json.schemastore.org/taskfile.json so it is be used automatically many code editors, like VSCode. Contributions can be done by editing [this file](https://github.com/go-task/task/blob/master/docs/static/schema.json).

### Visual Studio Code extension

Additionally, there's also some work done by [@paulvarache](https://github.com/paulvarache) in making an Visual Studio Code extension, which has its code [here](https://github.com/paulvarache/vscode-taskfile) and is published [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=paulvarache.vscode-taskfile).

### Sublime Text 4 package

There is a convenience wrapper for initializing and running tasks from Sublime Text's command palette. The package is developed by [@biozz](https://github.com/biozz), the source code is available [here](https://github.com/biozz/sublime-taskfile) and it is published on Package Control [here](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Taskfile).

### IntelliJ plugin

There's a JetBrains IntelliJ plugin done by [@lechuckroh](https://github.com/lechuckroh), which has its code [here](https://github.com/lechuckroh/task-intellij-plugin) and is published [here](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17058-taskfile).

## Other Integrations

- [mk](https://github.com/pycontribs/mk) command line tool recognizes Taskfiles natively.
