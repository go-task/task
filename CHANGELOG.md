# Changelog

# v3 - Unreleased

- Taskfiles in version 1 are not supported anymore
  ([#237](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/237)).

## v3.0.0 - Preview 1

- We're now using [slim-sprig](https://github.com/go-task/slim-sprig) instead of
  [sprig](https://github.com/Masterminds/sprig), which allowed a file size
  reduction of about 22%
  ([#219](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/219)).
- We now use some colors on Task output to better distinguish message types -
  commands are green, errors are red, etc
  ([#207](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/207)).

## Unreleased

- Fixed panic bug when assigning a global variable
  ([#229](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/229), [#243](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/234)).
- A task with `method: checksum` will now re-run if generated files are deleted
  ([#228](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/228), [#238](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/238)).

## v2.6.0 - 2019-07-21

  ([#209](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/209), [#211](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/211)).
- We now have a `--taskfile` flag (alias `-t`), which can be used to run
  another Taskfile (other than the default `Taskfile.yml`)
  ([#221](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/221)).
- It's now possible to install Task using Homebrew on Linux
  ([go-task/homebrew-tap#1](https://github.com/go-task/homebrew-tap/pull/1)).

  to use the new taskfile.dev domain on scripts from now on.
- Fixed to the ZSH completion
  ([#182](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/182)).
- Add [`--summary` flag along with `summary:` task attribute](https://taskfile.org/#/usage?id=display-summary-of-task)
  ([#180](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/180)).

## v2.4.0 - 2019-02-21
