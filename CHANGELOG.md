# Changelog

## v3.4.1 - 2021-04-17

- Improve error reporting when parsing YAML: in some situations where you
  would just see an generic error, you'll now see the actual error with
  more detail: the YAML line the failed to parse, for example
  ([#467](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/467)).
- A JSON Schema was published [here](https://json.schemastore.org/taskfile.json)
  and is automatically being used by some editors like Visual Studio Code
  ([#135](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/135)).
- Print task name before the command in the log output
  ([#398](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/398)).
- Improve version reporting when building Task from source using Go Modules
  ([#462](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/462)).

## v3.3.0 - 2021-03-20

- Add support for delegating CLI arguments to commands with `--` and a
  special `CLI_ARGS` variable
  ([#327](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/327)).
- Add a `--concurrency` (alias `-C`) flag, to limit the number of tasks that
  run concurrently. This is useful for heavy workloads.
  ([#345](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/345)).

## v3.2.2 - 2021-01-12

- Improve performance of `--list` and `--summary` by skipping running shell
  variables for these flags
  ([#332](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/332)).
- Fixed a bug where an environment in a Taskfile was not always overridable
  by the system environment
  ([#425](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/425)).
- Fixed environment from .env files not being available as variables
  ([#379](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/379)).
- The install script is now working for ARM platforms
  ([#428](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/428)).

## v3.2.1 - 2021-01-09

- Fixed some bugs and regressions regarding dynamic variables and directories
  ([#426](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/426)).
- The [slim-sprig](https://github.com/go-task/slim-sprig) package was updated
  with the upstream [sprig](https://github.com/Masterminds/sprig).

## v3.2.0 - 2021-01-07

- Fix the `.task` directory being created in the task directory instead of the
  Taskfile directory
  ([#247](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/247)).
- Fix a bug where dynamic variables (those declared with `sh:`) were not
  running in the task directory when the task has a custom dir or it was
  in an included Taskfile
  ([#384](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/384)).
- The watch feature (via the `--watch` flag) got a few different bug fixes and
  should be more stable now
  ([#423](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/423), [#365](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/365)).

## v3.1.0 - 2021-01-03

- Fix a bug when the checksum up-to-date resolution is used by a task
  with a custom `label:` attribute
  ([#412](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/412)).
- Starting from this release, we're releasing official ARMv6 and ARM64 binaries
  for Linux
  ([#375](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/375), [#418](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/418)).
- Task now respects the order of declaration of included Taskfiles when
  evaluating variables declaring by them
  ([#393](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/393)).
- `set -e` is now automatically set on every command. This was done to fix an
  issue where multiline string commands wouldn't really fail unless the
  sentence was in the last line
  ([#403](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/403)).

## v3.0.1 - 2020-12-26

- Allow use as a library by moving the required packages out of the `internal`
  directory
  ([#358](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/358)).
- Do not error if a specified dotenv file does not exist
  ([#378](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/378), [#385](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/385)).
- Fix panic when you have empty tasks in your Taskfile
  ([#338](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/338), [#362](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/362)).

## v3.0.0 - 2020-08-16

- On `v3`, all CLI variables will be considered global variables
  ([#336](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/336), [#341](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/341))
- Add support to `.env` like files
  ([#324](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/324), [#356](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/356)).
- Add `label:` to task so you can override the task name in the logs
  ([#321](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/321]), [#337](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/337)).
- Refactor how variables work on version 3
  ([#311](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/311)).
- Disallow `expansions` on v3 since it has no effect.
- `Taskvars.yml` is not automatically included anymore.
- `Taskfile_{{OS}}.yml` is not automatically included anymore.
- Allow interpolation on `includes`, so you can manually include a Taskfile
  based on operation system, for example.
- Expose `.TASK` variable in templates with the task name
  ([#252](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/252)).
- Implement short task syntax
  ([#194](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/194), [#240](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/240)).
- Added option to make included Taskfile run commands on its own directory
  ([#260](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/260), [#144](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/144))
- Taskfiles in version 1 are not supported anymore
  ([#237](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/237)).
- Added global `method:` option. With this option, you can set a default
  method to all tasks in a Taskfile
  ([#246](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/246)).
- Changed default method from `timestamp` to `checksum`
  ([#246](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/246)).
- New magic variables are now available when using `status:`:
  `.TIMESTAMP` which contains the greatest modification date
  from the files listed in `sources:`, and `.CHECKSUM`, which
  contains a checksum of all files listed in `status:`.
  This is useful for manual checking when using external, or even remote,
  artifacts when using `status:`
  ([#216](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/216)).
- We're now using [slim-sprig](https://github.com/go-task/slim-sprig) instead of
  [sprig](https://github.com/Masterminds/sprig), which allowed a file size
  reduction of about 22%
  ([#219](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/219)).
- We now use some colors on Task output to better distinguish message types -
  commands are green, errors are red, etc
  ([#207](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/207)).

## v2.8.1 - 2020-05-20

- Fix error code for the `--help` flag
  ([#300](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/300), [#330](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/330)).

  ([#299](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/299), [#329](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/329)).
- Supress `context` errors when using the `--watch` flag
  ([#313](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/313), [#317](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/317)).
- Support templating on description
  ([#276](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/276), [#283](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/283)).

## v2.8.0 - 2019-12-07

- Add `--parallel` flag (alias `-p`) to run tasks given by the command line in
  parallel
  ([#266](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/266)).
- Fixed bug where calling the `task` CLI only informing global vars would not
  execute the `default` task.
- Add hability to silent all tasks by adding `silent: true` a the root of the
  Taskfile.

  ([#251](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/251)).

## v2.7.0 - 2019-09-22

- Fixed panic bug when assigning a global variable
  ([#229](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/229), [#243](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/234)).
- A task with `method: checksum` will now re-run if generated files are deleted
  ([#228](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/228), [#238](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/238)).

## v2.6.0 - 2019-07-21

- Add `preconditions:` to task
  ([#205](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/205)).
- Create directory informed on `dir:` if it doesn't exist
  ([#209](https://github.com/go-task/task/issues/209), [#211](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/211)).
- We now have a `--taskfile` flag (alias `-t`), which can be used to run
  another Taskfile (other than the default `Taskfile.yml`)
  ([#221](https://github.com/go-task/task/pull/221)).
- It's now possible to install Task using Homebrew on Linux
  ([go-task/homebrew-tap#1](https://github.com/go-task/homebrew-tap/pull/1)).

## v2.5.2 - 2019-05-11
