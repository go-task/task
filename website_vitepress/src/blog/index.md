description="Task has always had variables, but even though you were able to define them using different YAML types, they would always be converted to strings by Task. This limited users to string manipulation and encouraged messy workarounds for simple problems. Starting from v3.37.0, this is no longer the case! Task now supports most variable types, including booleans, integers, floats and arrays!"

description="A look at where Task is, where it's going and how we're going to get there. Lately, Task has been growing extremely quickly and I've found myself thinking a lot about the future of the project and how we continue to evolve and grow. I'm not much of a writer, but I think one of the things we could do better is to communicate these kinds of thoughts to the community."
