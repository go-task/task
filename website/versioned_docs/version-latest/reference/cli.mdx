# CLI Reference

Task CLI commands have the following syntax:

```shell
task [--flags] [tasks...] [-- CLI_ARGS...]
```

:::tip

If `--` is given, all remaining arguments will be assigned to a special
`CLI_ARGS` variable

## Flags

## Exit Codes

Task will sometimes exit with specific exit codes. These codes are split into
three groups with the following ranges:

- General errors (0-99)
- Taskfile errors (100-199)
- Task errors (200-299)

A full list of the exit codes and their descriptions can be found below:

| Code | Description                                                  |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0    | Success                                                      |
| 1    | An unknown error occurred                                    |
| 100  | No Taskfile was found                                        |
| 101  | A Taskfile already exists when trying to initialize one      |
| 102  | The Taskfile is invalid or cannot be parsed                  |
| 103  | A remote Taskfile could not be downloaded                    |
| 104  | A remote Taskfile was not trusted by the user                |
| 105  | A remote Taskfile was could not be fetched securely          |
| 106  | No cache was found for a remote Taskfile in offline mode     |
| 107  | No schema version was defined in the Taskfile                |
| 200  | The specified task could not be found                        |
| 201  | An error occurred while executing a command inside of a task |
| 202  | The user tried to invoke a task that is internal             |
| 203  | There a multiple tasks with the same name or alias           |
| 204  | A task was called too many times                             |
| 205  | A task was cancelled by the user                             |
| 206  | A task was not executed due to missing required variables    |

These codes can also be found in the repository in
[`errors/errors.go`](https://github.com/go-task/task/blob/main/errors/errors.go).

:::info

When Task is run with the `-x`/`--exit-code` flag, the exit code of any failed
commands will be passed through to the user instead.

## JSON Output

When using the `--json` flag in combination with either the `--list` or
`--list-all` flags, the output will be a JSON object with the following
structure:

```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "name": "",
      "desc": "",
      "summary": "",
      "up_to_date": false,
      "location": {
        "line": 54,
        "column": 3,
        "taskfile": "/path/to/Taskfile.yml"
      }
    }
    // ...
  ],
  "location": "/path/to/Taskfile.yml"
}
```
