# Templating Reference

Task's templating engine uses Go's [text/template][text/template] package to
interpolate values. For detailed information about the usage of Go's templating
engine, we recommend reading [the official documentation][text/template].
However, we will provide a basic overview of the main features here.

## Basic Usage

Most string values in Task (though, not all) can be templated. The templating
engine uses double curly braces `{{` and `}}` to denote a template. Anything
inside the curly braces will be executed as a Go template and the result will be
inserted into the resulting string. For example:

```yaml
version: '3'

tasks:
  hello:
    vars:
      MESSAGE: 'Hello, World!'
    cmds:
      - 'echo {{.MESSAGE}}'
```

In this example, we have a task called `hello` with a single variable, `MESSAGE`
defined. When the command is run, the templating engine will evaluate the
variable and replace `{{.MESSAGE}}` with the variable's contents. This task will
output `Hello, World!` to the terminal. Note that when referring to a variable,
you must use dot notation.

You are also able to do more complex things in templates, such as conditional
logic:

```yaml
version: '3'

tasks:
  maybe-happy:
    vars:
      SMILE: ':\)'
      FROWN: ':\('
      HAPPY: true
    cmds:
      - 'echo {{if .HAPPY}}{{.SMILE}}{{else}}{{.FROWN}}{{end}}'
```

```txt
:)
```

...calling functions and piping values:

```yaml
version: '3'

tasks:
  uniq:
    vars:
      NUMBERS: '0,1,1,1,2,2,3'
    cmds:
      - 'echo {{splitList "," .NUMBERS | uniq | join ", " }}!'
```

```txt
0, 1, 2, 3
```

...looping over values with control flow operators:

```yaml
version: '3'

tasks:
  loop:
    vars:
      NUMBERS: [0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
    cmds:
      # Ranges over NUMBERS and prints the index and value of each number until it finds a number greater than 1
      - "{{range $index, $num := .NUMBERS}}{{if gt $num 1 }}{{break}}{{end}}echo {{$index}}: {{$num}}\n{{end}}"
```

```txt
0: 0
1: 1
2: 1
3: 1
```

## Special Variables

Task defines some special variables that are always available to the templating
engine. If you define a variable with the same name as a special variable, the
special variable will be overridden.

| Var                | Description                                                                                                                                              |

## Functions

Functions are provided at a few different levels in Task. Below, we list all the
functions available for use in Task.

:::note

Functions marked with an asterisk (\*) also have `must` variants that will panic
rather than erroring.

### Built-in Functions

The first set of functions are [provided by Golang
itself][go-template-functions]:

| Function   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `and`      | Returns the boolean AND of its arguments by returning the first empty argument or the last argument. That is, `and x y` behaves as `if x then y else x`. Evaluation proceeds through the arguments left to right and returns when the result is determined.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `call`     | Returns the result of calling the first argument, which must be a function, with the remaining arguments as parameters. Thus `call .X.Y 1 2` is, in Go notation, `dot.X.Y(1, 2)` where `Y` is a func-valued field, map entry, or the like. The first argument must be the result of an evaluation that yields a value of function type (as distinct from a predefined function such as print). The function must return either one or two result values, the second of which is of type error. If the arguments don't match the function or the returned error value is non-nil, execution stops. |
| `html`     | Returns the escaped HTML equivalent of the textual representation of its arguments. This function is unavailable in [html/template][html/template], with a few exceptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `index`    | Returns the result of indexing its first argument by the following arguments. Thus `index x 1 2 3` is, in Go syntax, `x[1][2][3]`. Each indexed item must be a map, slice, or array.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `slice`    | slice returns the result of slicing its first argument by the remaining arguments. Thus `slice x 1 2` is, in Go syntax, `x[1:2]`, while `slice x` is `x[:]`, `slice x 1` is `x[1:]`, and `slice x 1 2 3` is `x[1:2:3]`. The first argument must be a string, slice, or array.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `js`       | Returns the escaped JavaScript equivalent of the textual representation of its arguments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `len`      | Returns the integer length of its argument.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| `not`      | Returns the boolean negation of its single argument.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `or`       | Returns the boolean OR of its arguments by returning the first non-empty argument or the last argument, that is, `or x y` behaves as `if x then x else y`.
