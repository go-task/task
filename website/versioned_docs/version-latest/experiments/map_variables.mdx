# Map Variables (#1585)

:::caution

All experimental features are subject to breaking changes and/or removal _at any
time_. We strongly recommend that you do not use these features in a production
environment. They are intended for testing and feedback only.

:::

Currently, Task supports all variable types except for maps. This experiment
adds two different proposals for map variables. Click on the tabs below to
switch between them.

<Tabs defaultValue="1" queryString="proposal"
  values={[
    {label: 'Proposal 1', value: '1'},
    {label: 'Proposal 2', value: '2'}
  ]}>

<TabItem value="1">

:::warning

This experiment proposal breaks the following functionality:

- Dynamically defined variables (using the `sh` keyword)

:::

:::info

To enable this experiment, set the environment variable:
`TASK_X_MAP_VARIABLES=1`. Check out [our guide to enabling experiments
][enabling-experiments] for more information.

:::

This proposal removes support for the `sh` keyword in favour of a new syntax for
dynamically defined variables, This allows you to define a map directly as you
would for any other type:

```yaml
version: 3

tasks:
  foo:
    vars:
      FOO: {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3} # <-- Directly defined map on the `FOO` key
    cmds:
      - 'echo {{.FOO.a}}'
```

## Migration

Taskfiles with dynamically defined variables via the `sh` subkey will no longer
work with this experiment enabled. In order to keep using dynamically defined
variables, you will need to migrate your Taskfile to use the new syntax.

Previously, you might have defined a dynamic variable like this:

```yaml
version: 3

tasks:
  foo:
    vars:
      CALCULATED_VAR:
        sh: 'echo hello'
    cmds:
      - 'echo {{.CALCULATED_VAR}}'
```

With this experiment enabled, you will need to remove the `sh` subkey and define
your command as a string that begins with a `$`. This will instruct Task to
interpret the string as a command instead of a literal value and the variable
will be populated with the output of the command. For example:

```yaml
version: 3

tasks:
  foo:
    vars:
      CALCULATED_VAR: '$echo hello'
    cmds:
      - 'echo {{.CALCULATED_VAR}}'
```

If your current Taskfile contains a string variable that begins with a `$`, you
will now need to escape the `$` with a backslash (`\`) to stop Task from
executing it as a command.

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="2">

:::info

To enable this experiment, set the environment variable:
`TASK_X_MAP_VARIABLES=2`. Check out [our guide to enabling experiments
][enabling-experiments] for more information.

:::

This proposal maintains backwards-compatibility and the `sh` subkey and adds
another new `map` subkey for defining map variables:

```yaml
version: 3

tasks:
  foo:
    vars:
      FOO:
        map: {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3} # <-- Defined using the `map' subkey instead of directly on 'FOO'
      BAR: true # <-- Other types of variables are still defined directly on the key
      BAZ:
        sh: 'echo Hello Task' # <-- The `sh` subkey is still supported
    cmds:
      - 'echo {{.FOO.a}}'
```

## Parsing JSON and YAML

In addition to the new `map` keyword, this proposal also adds support for the
`json` and `yaml` keywords for parsing JSON and YAML strings into real
objects/arrays. This is similar to the `fromJSON` template function, but means
that you only have to parse the JSON/YAML once when you declare the variable,
instead of every time you want to access a value.

<Tabs defaultValue="2"
  values={[
    {label: 'Before', value: '1'},
    {label: 'After', value: '2'}
  ]}>

<TabItem value="1">

```yaml
version: 3

tasks:
  foo:
    vars:
      FOO: '{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}' # <-- JSON string
    cmds:
      - 'echo {{(fromJSON .FOO).a}}' # <-- Parse JSON string every time you want to access a value
      - 'echo {{(fromJSON .FOO).b}}'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="2">

```yaml
version: 3

tasks:
  foo:
    vars:
      FOO:
        json: '{"a": 1, "b": 2, "c": 3}' # <-- JSON string parsed once
    cmds:
      - 'echo {{.FOO.a}}' # <-- Access values directly
      - 'echo {{.FOO.b}}'
```

</TabItem></Tabs>

## Variables by reference

Lastly, this proposal adds support for defining and passing variables by
reference. This is really important now that variables can be types other than a
string.

Previously, to send a variable from one task to another, you would have to use
the templating system. Unfortunately, the templater _always_ outputs a string
and operations on the passed variable may not have behaved as expected. With
this proposal, you can now pass variables by reference using the `ref` subkey:

<Tabs defaultValue="2"
  values={[
    {label: 'Before', value: '1'},
    {label: 'After', value: '2'}
  ]}>

<TabItem value="1">

```yaml
version: 3

tasks:
  foo:
    vars:
      FOO: [A, B, C] # <-- FOO is defined as an array
    cmds:
      - task: bar
        vars:
          FOO: '{{.FOO}}' # <-- FOO gets converted to a string when passed to bar
  bar:
    cmds:
      - 'echo {{index .FOO 0}}' # <-- FOO is a string so the task outputs '91' which is the ASCII code for '[' instead of the expected 'A'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="2">

```yaml
version: 3

tasks:
  foo:
    vars:
      FOO: [A, B, C] # <-- FOO is defined as an array
    cmds:
      - task: bar
        vars:
          FOO:
            ref: .FOO # <-- FOO gets passed by reference to bar and maintains its type
  bar:
    cmds:
      - 'echo {{index .FOO 0}}' # <-- FOO is still a map so the task outputs 'A' as expected
```

</TabItem></Tabs>

This means that the type of the variable is maintained when it is passed to
another Task. This also works the same way when calling `deps` and when defining
a variable and can be used in any combination:

```yaml
version: 3

tasks:
  foo:
    vars:
      FOO: [A, B, C] # <-- FOO is defined as an array
      BAR:
        ref: .FOO # <-- BAR is defined as a reference to FOO
    deps:
      - task: bar
        vars:
          BAR:
            ref: .BAR # <-- BAR gets passed by reference to bar and maintains its type
  bar:
    cmds:
      - 'echo {{index .BAR 0}}' # <-- BAR still refers to FOO so the task outputs 'A'
```

All references use the same templating syntax as regular templates, so in
addition to simply calling `.FOO`, you can also pass subkeys (`.FOO.BAR`) or
indexes (`index .FOO 0`) and use functions (`len .FOO`):

```yaml
version: 3

tasks:
  foo:
    vars:
      FOO: [A, B, C] # <-- FOO is defined as an array
    cmds:
      - task: bar
        vars:
          FOO:
            ref: index .FOO 0 # <-- The element at index 0 is passed by reference to bar
  bar:
    cmds:
      - 'echo {{.MYVAR}}' # <-- FOO is just the letter 'A'
```

</TabItem></Tabs>

## Looping over maps

This experiment also adds support for looping over maps using the `for` keyword,
just like arrays. In addition to the `{{.ITEM}}` variable being populated when
looping over a map, we also make an additional `{{.KEY}}` variable available
that holds the string value of the map key.

<Tabs defaultValue="1" queryString="proposal"
  values={[
    {label: 'Proposal 1', value: '1'},
    {label: 'Proposal 2', value: '2'}
  ]}>

<TabItem value="1">

```yaml
version: 3

tasks:
  foo:
    vars:
      MAP: {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
    cmds:
      - for:
          var: MAP
        cmd: 'echo "{{.KEY}}: {{.ITEM}}"'
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="2">

```yaml
version: 3

tasks:
  foo:
    vars:
      map:
        MAP: {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
    cmds:
      - for:
          var: MAP
        cmd: 'echo "{{.KEY}}: {{.ITEM}}"'
```

:::note

Remember that maps are unordered, so
the order in which the items are looped over is random.
