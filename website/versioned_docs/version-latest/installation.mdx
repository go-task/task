# Installation

Task offers many installation methods. Check out the available methods below.

## Package Managers

### Homebrew

If you're on macOS or Linux and have [Homebrew][homebrew] installed, getting
Task is as simple as running:

```shell
brew install go-task/tap/go-task
```

The above Formula is
[maintained by ourselves](https://github.com/go-task/homebrew-tap/blob/main/Formula/go-task.rb).

Recently, Task was also made available
[on the official Homebrew repository](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/go-task),
so you also have that option if you prefer:

```shell
brew install go-task
```

### pkgx

If you're on macOS or Linux and have [pkgx][pkgx] installed, getting Task is as
simple as running:

```shell
pkgx task
```

or, if you have pkgx integration enabled:

```shell
task
```

This installation method is community owned. After a new release of Task, they
are automatically released by pkgx in a minimum of time.

### Snap

Task is available in [Snapcraft][snapcraft], but keep in mind that your Linux
distribution should allow classic confinement for Snaps to Task work right:

```shell
sudo snap install task --classic
```

### Chocolatey

If you're on Windows and have [Chocolatey][choco] installed, getting Task is as
simple as running:

```shell
choco install go-task
```

This installation method is community owned.

### Scoop

If you're on Windows and have [Scoop][scoop] installed, getting Task is as
simple as running:

```shell
scoop install task
```

This installation method is community owned. After a new release of Task, it may
take some time until it's available on Scoop.

### AUR

If you're on Arch Linux you can install Task from
[AUR](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/go-task-bin) using your favorite
package manager such as `yay`, `pacaur` or `yaourt`:

```shell
yay -S go-task-bin
```

Alternatively, there's
[this package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/go-task) which installs from
the source code instead of downloading the binary from the
[releases page](https://github.com/go-task/task/releases):

```shell
yay -S go-task
```

This installation method is community owned.

### Fedora

If you're on Fedora Linux you can install Task from the official
[Fedora](https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/golang-github-task/go-task/)
repository using `dnf`:

```shell
sudo dnf install go-task
```

This installation method is community owned. After a new release of Task, it may
take some time until it's available in
[Fedora](https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/golang-github-task/go-task/).

### Nix

If you're on NixOS or have Nix installed you can install Task from
[nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs):

```shell
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.go-task
```

This installation method is community owned. After a new release of Task, it may
take some time until it's available in
[nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs).

### npm

You can also use Node and npm to install Task by installing
[this package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@go-task/cli).

```shell
npm install -g @go-task/cli
```

### Winget

If you are using Windows and installed the
[winget](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-cli) package management tool, you
can install Task from [winget-pkgs](https://github.com/microsoft/winget-pkgs).

```shell
winget install Task.Task
```

### Pacstall
If you are using Debian or Ubuntu, and have [Pacstall](https://pacstall.dev/) installed, you can install Task by running:

```shell
pacstall -I go-task-deb
```

This installation method is community owned. After a new release of Task, it may take some time until it's available in [Pacstall](https://pacstall.dev/packages/go-task-deb).

## Get The Binary

### Binary

You can download the binary from the [releases page on GitHub][releases] and add
to your `$PATH`.

DEB and RPM packages are also available.

The `task_checksums.txt` file contains the SHA-256 checksum for each file.

### Install Script

We also have an [install script][installscript] which is very useful in
scenarios like CI. Many thanks to [GoDownloader][godownloader] for enabling the
easy generation of this script.

By default, it installs on the `./bin` directory relative to the working
directory:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d
```

It is possible to override the installation directory with the `-b` parameter.
On Linux, common choices are `~/.local/bin` and `~/bin` to install for the
current user or `/usr/local/bin` to install for all users:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d -b ~/.local/bin
```

:::caution

On macOS and Windows, `~/.local/bin` and `~/bin` are not added to `$PATH` by
default.

:::

By default, it installs the latest version available.
You can also specify a tag (available in [releases](https://github.com/go-task/task/releases))
to install a specific version:

```shell
sh -c "$(curl --location https://taskfile.dev/install.sh)" -- -d v3.36.0
```

### GitHub Actions

If you want to install Task in GitHub Actions you can try using
[this action](https://github.com/arduino/setup-task) by the Arduino team:

```yaml
- name: Install Task
  uses: arduino/setup-task@v2
  with:
    version: 3.x
    repo-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

This installation method is community owned.

## Build From Source

### Go Modules

Ensure that you have a supported version of [Go][go] properly installed and
setup. You can find the minimum required version of Go in the
[go.mod](https://github.com/go-task/task/blob/main/go.mod#L3) file.

You can then install the latest release globally by running:

```shell
go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest
```

Or you can install into another directory:

```shell
env GOBIN=/bin go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest
```

:::tip

For CI environments we recommend using the [install script](#install-script)
instead, which is faster and more stable, since it'll just download the latest
released binary.

## Setup completions

Some installation methods will automatically install completions too, but if
this isn't working for you or your chosen method doesn't include them, you can
run `task --completion <shell>` to output a completion script for any supported
shell. There are a couple of ways these completions can be added to your shell
config:

### Option 1. Load the completions in your shell's startup config (Recommended)

This method loads the completion script from the currently installed version of
task every time you create a new shell. This ensures that your completions are
always up-to-date.

<Tabs values={[ {label: 'bash', value: '1'}, {label: 'zsh', value: '2'},
    {label: 'fish', value: '3'},
    {label: 'powershell', value: '4'}
  ]}>

<TabItem value="1">
```shell title="~/.bashrc"
eval "$(task --completion bash)"
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="2">
```shell title="~/.zshrc"
eval "$(task --completion zsh)"
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="3">
```shell title="~/.config/fish/config.fish"
task --completion fish | source
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="4">
```powershell title="$PROFILE\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1"
Invoke-Expression (&task --completion powershell)
```
</TabItem></Tabs>

### Option 2. Copy the script to your shell's completions directory

This method requires you to manually update the completions whenever Task is
updated. However, it is useful if you want to modify the completions yourself.

<Tabs
  values={[
    {label: 'bash', value: '1'},
    {label: 'zsh', value: '2'},
    {label: 'fish', value: '3'}
  ]}>

<TabItem value="1">
```shell
task --completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/task
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="2">
```shell
task --completion zsh  > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_task
```
</TabItem>

<TabItem value="3">
```shell
task --completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/task.fish
```
</TabItem></Tabs>
