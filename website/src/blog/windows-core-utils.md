# Announcing Built-in Core Utilities for Windows

<AuthorCard :author="$frontmatter.author" />

When I started Task back in 2017, one of my biggest goals was to build a task
runner that would work well on all major platforms, including Windows.
At the time, I was using Windows as my main platform, and it caught my attention
how much of a pain it was to get a working version of Make on Windows, for
example.

## The very beginning

The very first versions, which looked very prototyp-ish, already supported
Windows, but it was falling back to Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`) to run commands
if `bash` wasn't available in the system. That didn't mean you couldn't run
Bash commands on Windows necessarily, because if you used Task inside Git Bash,
it would expose `bash.exe` into your `$PATH`, which made possible for Task to
use it. Outside of it, you would be out of luck, though, because running on
Command Prompt meant that the commands wouldn't be really compatible.

## Adopting a shell interpreter

I didn't take too much time to discover that there was
[a shell interpreter for Go that was very solid][mvdan], and I quickly adopted
it to ensure we would be able to run commands with consistency across all
platforms. It was fun because once adopted, I had the opportunity to
[make some contributions to make it more stable][mvdan-prs], which I'm sure the
author appreciated.

## The lack of core utilities

There was one important thing missing, though. If you needed to use any core
utilities on Windows, like copying files with `cp`, moving with `mv`, creating
a directory with `mkdir -p`, that likely would just fail :boom:.
There were workarounds, of course. You could run `task` inside Git Bash which
exposed core utils in `$PATH` for you, or you could install these core utils
manually (there are a good number of alternative implementations available
for download).

That was still far from ideal, though. One of my biggest goals with Task is that it
should "just work", even on Windows. Requiring additional setup to make
things work is exactly what I wanted to avoid.

## They finally arrive!

And here we are, in 2025, 8 years after the initial release. We might be late,
but I'm happy nonetheless. From now on, the following core utilities will be
available on Windows. This is the start. We want to add more with time.

* `base64`
* `cat`
* `chmod`
* `cp`
* `find`
* `gzip`
* `ls`
* `mkdir`
* `mktemp`
* `mv`
* `rm`
* `shasum`
* `tar`
* `touch`
* `xargs`

## How we made this possible

This was made possible via a collaboration with the maintainers of other Go
projects.

### u-root/u-root

We are using the core utilities implementations in Go from the
[u-root][u-root] project. It wasn't as simple as it sounds because they have
originally implemented every core util as a standalone `main` package, which
means we couldn't just import and use them as libraries. We had some discussion
and we agreed on a common [interface][uroot-interface] and
[base implementation][uroot-base]. Then, I refactored one-by-one of the core
utils in the list above. This is the reason we don't have all of them: there are
too many! But the good news is that we can refactor more with time and include
them in Task.

### mvdan/sh

The other collaboration was with the maintainer of the shell interpreter.
He agreed on having [an official middleware][middleware] to expose these core
utilities.
This means that other projects that use the shell interpreter can also benefit
from this work, and as more utilities are included, those projects will benefit
as well.

## Can I choose whether to use them or not?

Yes. We added a new environment variable called
[`TASK_CORE_UTILS`][task-core-utils] to control if the Go implementations are
used or not. By default, this is `true` on Windows and `false` on other
platforms. You can override it like this:

```bash
# Enable, even on non-Windows platforms
env TASK_CORE_UTILS=1 task ...

# Disable, even on Windows
env TASK_CORE_UTILS=0 task ...
```

We'll consider making this enabled by default on all platforms in the future.
In the meantime, we're still using the system core utils on non-Windows
platforms to avoid regressions as the Go implementations may not be 100%
compatible with the system ones.
