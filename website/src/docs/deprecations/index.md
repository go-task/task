# Deprecations

As Task evolves, it occasionally outgrows some of its functionality. This can be
because they are no longer useful, because another feature has replaced it or
because of a change in the way that Task works internally.

When this happens, we mark the functionality as deprecated. This means that it
will be removed in a future version of Task. This functionality will continue to
work until that time, but we strongly recommend that you do not implement this
functionality in new Taskfiles and make a plan to migrate away from it as soon
as possible.

You can view a full list of active deprecations in the "Deprecations" section of
the sidebar.
